[tuxi](https://github.com/bugswriter/tuxi), [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/), [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/), [cat](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/cat-invocation.html), [festival](http://festvox.org/festival/) with a voice pack(festival festival-us festival-english need to be downloaded for arch based distros)
## Installation
Install the dependencies and create the files tuxi.txt and file.txt in your home directory. Make Sure the files are empty

Then git clone the repo and put tuxivoice in /usr/bin.

That is it, you have installed tuxivoice
## Useful Tips
To Clear History Delete the contents of tuxi.txt

if dmenu doesn't display, do the command 

export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 

This will set your locale as en_US with UTF-8.

This is a very well supported locale, so it will work flawlessly with dmenu.
